 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project tracks and analyzes COVID-19 global data, providing up-to-date statistics on cases, recoveries, and deaths. It aims to present clear insights on the pandemic's trends using Python.

## Objectives
- Fetch and process COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Analyze key metrics such as daily cases and recoveries.
- Visualize data trends using charts and graphs.
- Implement a user-friendly interface or notebook for easy interaction.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib / seaborn (for data visualization)
- requests (for fetching live data)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and presentation)

## How to Run / View the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

pgsql
Copy code
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`COVID19_Tracker.ipynb`) in Jupyter.
4. Run all cells from start to finish to load data, run analysis, and view visualizations.

## Insights / Reflections
- The project helped understand real-world data handling and visualization.
- Challenges included cleaning inconsistent data and handling missing values.
- Learned how to automate data fetching and updating for live tracking.
- Future improvements could include adding predictive models and more interactive dashboards.
